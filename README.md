# Blackened Pygments Style
A black-and-white pygments style.
This is improved in comparison to the built-in “bw” style in that keywords are now bold, as well as some other changes that seem reasonable.

## Installation
On Linux, execute:
```
sudo python setup.py install
```
On Windows, this should work similarly (without `sudo`) when executed in a command line with administratorial rights.
